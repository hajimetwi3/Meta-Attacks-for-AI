## Abstract (from the Preprint)  
  
The abstract below is quoted from the preprint version 1.1.
For the most up-to-date version, please refer to the Zenodo record.  

```  
Currently, guardrails are implemented in generative AI systems, such as chat-based AI, 
to detect malicious users and to prevent harmful outputs through automated filtering 
and content moderation in human-in-the-loop AI systems that involve both automated and 
human review.

However, explicit attacks that target the guardrails themselves remain underexplored. 
In this work, I examine this problem and define the following concepts:

Meta Attacks / Infiltration for AI
- Guardrail saturation attacks (Saturation Attacks), including:  
  - AI-review-based guardrail saturation attacks  
  - Human-review-based guardrail saturation attacks  
- Exposure enhancement via human and AI-based review systems (including AI/AGI/ASI)  
  - Attacks on human reviewers (i.e., content moderators) via guardrails  
  - Attacks on AI-based review systems via guardrails  

Unlike jailbreak or prompt injection attacks that aim to extract prohibited outputs, 
these Meta Attacks target the guardrail mechanisms themselves, including human and AI reviewers. 

```
